 This project is only for people who are interested in building virtual assistants. 
 Usually, it takes a lot of time to write code from scratch to build a virtual assistant. 
 Jarvis is a Python coding companion. Point it to a python function, and it will execute it. As soon as you change and save your code, Jarvis will detect it, and will rerun the function.

If an exception is raised, it will be displayed in the error panel.

If you insert some debugging statements in your code, they will be displayed in the debug panel.
